Sets don't allow for duplicates and don't let you access elements by positional indexing (i.e., by stating the position the element has in the object), because they don't naturally have order. You can't change the elements of a set, but you can add new elements. You can perform various kinds of operations using sets, such as set intersections, set differences, and set unions - these all fall under set logic.\n",
    "* **Lists**. Lists are ordered. They allow for duplicates and let you access elements by positional indexing. You can delete, add, or modify elements in a list, without needing to create the list again.\n",
    "* **Tuples**. These are basically like lists, with the difference that tuples are immutable. This means that if you want to modify the contents of a tuple, you have to create it from scratch with the modified data.\n",
    "* **Dictionaries**. Dictionaries act a lot like lists (and are mutable too), but you don't access the elements using positional indexes. You use key names instead.
