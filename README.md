# DS4A
### I was accepted into Correlation One's Data Science for All (DS4A) program that has a less than 5% acceptance rate.
### This repository will consist of work I completed in the Data Science For all Program 2022-2023.
### Through this program I will complete review modules that consist of various data science use cases and will collaborate with peers on a final project.
### So far I have been using Jupyter Notebook and Python.
